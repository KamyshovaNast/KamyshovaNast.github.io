                <p>Though the Forgefire Parliament ostensibly governs the Cybetronian colony of Caminus, it's clear that the people of Caminus revere the <strong>Mistress of Flame</strong>. The high priestess of the Way of Flame, the Mistress and her adherents believe that the the original Thirteen Transformers were gods, and that each inhabitant of Caminus possesses a piece of the spark of Solus Prime; supported by an order of Torchbearers assembled to uphold the legacy of Solus Prime, the Mistress is an imposing figure who both commands and demands respect—and doesn't take blasphemers lightly.
</p>
                <p>While a devout practitioner of her faith, the latest Transformer to hold the title of Mistress is also a canny and adept manipulator when it comes to matters more secular. The arrival of Optimus Prime—supposedly the mythical "Thirteenth Prime"—proved a boon to her, and as the interstellar Council of Worlds takes shape, she's resolved to build Optimus into her idea of what a worthy Prime should represent... whether he wants to or not.
</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"It is only the purest servant of Solus Prime who can keep forging until they reach the real miracle... the creation of a single true thing"
                    </p>
                    <cite>— The Mistress of Flame</cite>
</blockquote>
                <p>In the distant past, before the energon shortages made space travel impossible, Caminus detected a Cybertronian beacon from the planet Antilla. The linguist Magrada was sent along with Praesidia and the Matriarch of Incaendium. Upon arriving on the planet, the trio found an unnatural mechanical mountain. Despite Magrada's warnings, the Matriarch approached the mountain which split open to reveal an enormous optic and the ruler of the land: Onyx Prime. 
</p>
                <p>The bestial Prime beheaded Magrada while the other two Camiens escaped. Upon returning to Caminus, it was found that the Mistress of Flame had perished and the Matriarch ascended to the position. Her first act was to promote Praesidia to leadership of the Torchbearers. The experience would forever haunt the Mistress.  
</p>
                <p>Following a disastrous Torchbearer mission where both Praesidia Magna and Fastbreak were killed in action, the Mistress met with Pyra, who was experiencing recurring nightmares of her commander's death on Antilla.
</p>
                <p>The Mistress recounted her discovery of Antilla, but accepted Praesidia's death as part of the will of the Primes. Though Pyra was still uneasy about the circumstances behind her commander's death, she remained a member of the Torchbearers, taking command of the group and becoming "Pyra Magna". The Mistress would subsequently cover up this attack.
</p>
                <p>When the Cybertronian explorer Thunderclash made contact with Caminus shortly after the end of the Great War, the Mistress of Flame chose Windblade, Chromia, and Nautica to join his crew in the hopes of reconnecting with their ancestral homeworld and gather aid for their dying planet.   
</p>
                <p>Contact with Cybertron would arrive some years later, though not in the way that the Camiens had anticipated; following the reintroduction of Cybertron to Caminus by way of a violent rampage by Menasor and his defeat by Superion, Windblade requested an audience with the Mistress of Flame. Presumably, the Cityspeaker explained that Optimus Prime, keeper of the Matrix of Leadership, was visiting, and all that that implied, as subsequently she arrived to greet the former Autobot commander. 
</p>
                <p>Upstaging Starscream's attempt at first contact with Caminus's ruling body, Optimus Prime displayed that he was a Matrix bearer as the Mistress of Flame and the others bowed before him. The Mistress became convinced that Optimus was none other than "The Arisen": the incarnation of the legendary Thirteenth Prime.
