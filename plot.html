                <h2>A 'bot and Her City</h2>
                <p>Six months after the defeat of Shockwave and the foiling of his attempt to fulfill the Dark Cybertron prophecy, Metroplex has become the only city left standing on Cybertron, in which the inhabitants of the ruined Iacon now live, still governed by Starscream. But Metroplex remains damaged, making life difficult for those who now dwell within him, and so Starscream employs Windblade for her talents as a Cityspeaker to communicate with the Titan and work towards effecting repairs.</p>
                <p>On the morning of her 186th day on Cybertron, Windblade watches the sunrise with a wistful longing for her homeworld, Caminus, before heading off to meet with Starscream over the latest problem, a series of rolling blackouts within Metroplex. Chromia surprises her with an impromptu weapons training session, which she loses quite quickly, and the pair then receive Starscream and Rattrap for the meeting. 

</p>
                <p>Chromia and Rattrap are "invited" to stand outside—where Rattrap gets no response from Chromia when he tries to make some small talk about their unusual gender—and once they have gone, Starscream quietly threatens Windblade, suspecting that she may be deliberately undermining his leadership by working with Metroplex to cause the various problems in the city.</p>
                <p>As Starscream and Rattrap then depart, Chromia makes her dislike of her new leader known, but Windblade admits that his frustration is not exactly misplaced: they have thus far failed to remedy the blackouts. Consulting with Metroplex, using her talents to read the patterns of light across his brain module, Windblade traces the problem to a diversion of power at junction T134.</p>
                <p>The only problem is, neither she nor Chromia have any idea where that junction might be, so they realize they will have to seek out the one 'bot who might: Ironhide, whose faith has been shaken by the fact that Shockwave's scheme has created undeniable contradictions in the vision of the future he saw, and who now wanders the depths of Metroplex hoping to find answers.

</p>
                <div class="fi"></div>
                <p>Chromia complains, finding the old 'bot "mopey", but gets visibly alarmed when Windblade teasingly suggests she'll pass on the sentiment when she finds him. Jetting off into the bowels of Metroplex, Windblade soon tracks Ironhide down, and he points her in the direction of the junction she needs, beneath the Acrolight District.</p>
                <p>Curious about Starscream, Windblade asks Ironhide for his opinion on the Seeker-turned-politician, and he suggests she would be better served asking his former Decepticon comrades, rather than his old enemies.</p>
                <p>Windblade and Chromia meet back up to explore underneath the Acrolight District, but several hours of searching only get them as far as junction T127. Chromia insists they call it a night and resume the search in the morning, but rather than go home, Windblade decides to pay a visit to Maccadam's Old Oil House, where she is warmly welcomed by owner Blurr.</p>
                <p>After a couple of drinks, she asks the various patrons for their views on Starscream, and the universal opinion quickly becomes clear: everyone hates him because he's only out for himself.</p>
                <p>This learning experience unnerves Windblade, and Chromia can tell right away that something is bothering her when they meet the next morning to continue their search.</p>
                <p>Before they can talk over the matter, however, a huge explosion erupts out of the access shaft they are about to enter, gravely damaging Windblade, though she still fights to grab an orange wire she spots poking out of the rubble before collapsing. Taken in for repairs, Windblade dreams of her homeworld, Caminus... though Caminus is more than just a planet.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="p1" id="p2">
                <h2>A Long Way Down</h2>
                <p>It—or rather, he, her dreams reveal—is one of the Titans, who left Cybertron in the planet's murky prehistory, settling on a planet that his city-form spread out across, where he gave birth to a new generation of Transformers from the hot spot within him. The vagaries of fate caused Caminus and his people to lose contact with Cybertron, but Windblade—one of Caminus's Cityspeakers, raised on tales of their ancient homeworld—was thrilled when Thunderclash arrived on their world and recruited them to help heal the damaged Metroplex.</p>
                <p>But her hopes of a joyful reunion with a peaceful Cybertron that would help the Camiens and grow with them together have been dashed... because the explosion, Windblade realizes, was Starscream's doing, a deliberate attempt on her life, perpetrated by Rattrap. And as the city leader enters the med-bay, she realizes he is certain to try again...</p>
                <p>With faithful camerabot Longtooth at his side, Circuit attempts to conduct interviews with various civilians regarding the bombing in Acrolight. Chromia refuses to speak to him, and when he visits Maccadam's Old Oil House, Blurr kicks him out after he is able to extract only the briefest testimonials from the Tankors and a downhearted Waspinator.</p>
                <p>As Starscream and Rattrap come to visit the injured Windblade at the medibay, Chromia bars their way, threatening to report the blast to Optimus Prime per the Autobot leader's instructions. Starscream cooly informs Chromia that if she had any proof, she would have done so already, and brushes past her to see Windblade, to whom he offers a veiled warning.</p>
                <p>Putting on a brave face, Windblade demands that he leave, and after he does so, she tells Chromia about the orange wire she discovered at the site of the blast—part of an igniter capsule. Before she can give voice to her theory, the two females realize that Circuit and Longtooth are secretly filming them; after Chromia scares them off, Windblade says what they're both thinking: that Starscream had Rattrap set off the blast.</p>
                <p>Chromia warns her to watch what she says, so the pair set off for a more secluded spot, their departure watched by Starscream and Rattrap, who are already planning their next move. Windblade and Chromia meet with Ironhide, who has been guarding Metroplex's brain in their absence. He is unsurprised to hear Windblade's theory, but encourages her to find tangible proof against Starscream before pursuing any action.</p>
                <p>Suspecting that the blast was meant to cover up some activity of Starscream's within Metroplex, a forlorn Windblade consults with the Titan to try and pinpoint which of the many problems going on inside him could be the Seeker's doing, but is faced with too many possibilities to narrow it down. Fortunately, Chromia and Ironhide have turned up a lead while watching Circuit's footage: Waspinator remarked that knew he was "not wanted" in the city's underground, which indicates someone told him to keep out.</p>
                <p>Windblade and Chromia head straight for Maccadam's, and although Waspinator immediately bolts when they try to question him, Chromia quickly subdues him. Windblade takes pity on the put-upon 'bot and tries offering him some compassion, but it isn't enough for Waspinator to overcome his fear of whoever or whatever warned him out of the underground.</p>
                <div class="sec"></div>
                <p>However, while he refuses to name names, he agrees to lead Windblade to the underground site where the encounter took place—Metroplex's filtration systems. Even her disgust at the sight of Waspinator slurping down energon from Metroplex's internal reservoirs doesn't stop Windblade from realizing what is going on.</p>
                <p>Starscream is trying to obtain one or both of the Regenesis ores that Metroplex was infused with by filtering them out of the Titan's system. She immediately streaks off for the surface, with Waspinator close behind, but their departure is observed by a monstrous shadow...</p>
                <p>Windblade gets in touch with Circuit, and allows herself to be interviewed in Maccadam's soon after, telling the reporter the entire story. Circuit asks for proof, and Windblade leads him, her allies, and some of the bar's interested patrons, down into Starscream's "mine" so they can see for themselves. Soon after their arrival, a skittering in the shadows is followed by an energy blast that Chromia blocks with her shield; someone is here to ensure that the group does not leave the mine alive, and as figures emerge from the shadows around them, Windblade draws her sword and prepares for battle.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="p1" id="p3">
                <h2>Part 3</h2>
                <p>Deep within Metroplex, Windblade and her allies are confronted by three of the Terrorcons. As the monstrous Decepticons taunt them, Blurrcautions Windblade to reign herself in, but she cannot: though once deemed "too centred" to be a Cityspeaker, she is fiercely protective of Metroplex, and hurls herself into action to protect him. Taking to the air in jet mode, she is caught off-guard by Cutthroat, not having expected him to be able to fly, prompting Chromia to abandon the others in favour of aiding her friend. </p>
                <p>Though chagrined, Blurr is quick to organize the rest of the group, ordering  Tankor to help Windblade in the air while he tackles Sinnertwin and Slug engages Rippersnapper. At Circuit's urging, Longtooth films the ensuing fracas, which goes poorly for the Autobots; Slug is laid out, and Blurr is sent crashing into the luckless Waspinator, and although Windblade is able to take down Cutthroat, she herself is then knocked from the sky by Starscream, who arrests her for crimes against Cybertron.</p>
                <p>Rattrap cuffs the rest of the group, but Chromia manages to slip away in the confusion. Later, in an undisclosed prison, Starscream introduces Blurr and the others to the "Badgeless", Starscream's new police force, whose identities are hidden by masks to protect them against public aggression.</p>
                <p>Dismissing his enforcers, Starscream threatens the rest of the group with imprisonment and execution, professing that he can justify it by claiming they were helping Windblade damage Metroplex's systems in order to help her stage a coup. Longtooth unwisely speaks up to say that he has video evidence proving that is untrue, but Starscream calmly and menacingly points out that he can remove that from the equation by simply killing him.</p>
                <p>With Longtooth silenced, he invites the incarcerated 'bots to ensure their own liberation by siding with him in his mission to remove Windblade from her position of power. Blurr spits his offer back in his face, but Starscream doubts that all those imprisoned will sacrifice their freedom and possibly their lives for an alien they don't even really know...</p>
                <p>Elsewhere in the prison, Windblade is tortured by Rattrap for information on the location of Chromia and the "real" reason she was sent to Cybertron. Presently, Starscream arrives, and with the torture having yielded no information, he instead elects to undo her bonds, doubting she will cause much trouble. He is entirely wrong, as she immediately lunges for him and tries to tear his head off, but he quickly overpowers her.</p>
                <p>Though he admits to tampering with Metroplex's filters in pursuit of the Regenesis ores in his system, Starscream refutes Windblade's accusation that he was attempting to kill the Titan; then, when she blames him for the bomb that nearly killed her, his look of confusion is punctuated by the baffled Rattrap, who starts to say that they weren't responsible for the blast, until Starscream silences him and orders him to take Windblade back to her cell.</p>
                <p>Returned to the cells with her allies, Windblade thinks over the revelations from the torture session until Chromia bursts in with Sky-Byte and Swindle in a daring escape attempt. While Blurr and the others remain behind to distract Starscream and his guards, Chromia and Windblade race off to Metroplex's brain. Chromia is stunned when Windblade reveals that Starscream has not been behind all the trouble plaguing Metroplex, but someone else instead...</p>
                <p>...someone who has been rerouting the power drained from throughout Metroplex to reactivate the Titan's spacebridge!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="p1" id="p4">
                <h2>Part 4</h2>
                <p>Windblade and Chromia race to Metroplex's brain with Starscream's enforcers hot on their tail when another blackout plunges the city into darkness. Chromia advocates simply killing their pursuers, but in deference to Windblade, she simply disables them by clipping their wings with her bladed weapons. As Metroplex begins to convulse all around them, the pair take refuge in Metroplex's brain chamber—but even a barred door proves no obstacle to Starscream himself, who has dealt with Blurr and Slug and has arrived to put an end to Windblade.</p>
                <p>Chromia engages Starscream in battle; as Windblade fails to convince them to stop fighting, she is instead faced with a daunting task: to risk her own life by mentally merging with Metroplex in order to gain full control over his stricken systems.</p>
                <p>Chromia holds her own in the fight, but Starscream takes the upper hand when he hurls his sword at the distracted Windblade, tearing a gash in her shoulder. As Chromia instinctively turns to aid her friend, Starscream cuts off her arm with his second blade. Standing victorious over the two fallen females, Starscream gloats that they could never have beaten him because he was chosen by the Titan under Crystal City.</p>
                <p>Windblade, with the last of her strength, plugs an interface cable into her head—directly linking herself to Metroplex. The chamber comes alive at Windblade's command, blasting Starscream back and restraining him against the wall. With the mental link, Windblade probes all of Metroplex's systems, realizing that the blackouts have been orchestrated to divert power to the Titan's space bridge.</p>
                <p>Through the bridge, she is offered glimpses of many of the other worlds across the galaxy that were colonized by Titans, but finds that she cannot sense the beacon of Caminus. Perceptions being to swim and blur as Windblade and Metroplex become further and further intertwined, and the truth is revealed to the cityspeaker: the one who was responsible for the blackouts was Chromia!</p>
                <div class="metro"></div>
                <p>Chromia tries to reason with Windblade, explaining that her plot was all for a single reason—to try and get Windblade home. Chromia refuses see her friend killed for Cybertronians, and insists that Windblade would never return to Caminus alive unless she was forced to do so. Chromia continues to attempt to coax Windblade/Metroplex into activating the bridge.</p>
                <p>Starscream screams in protest, noting with distress that, as Metroplex is now integrated with Iacon, using the spacebridge would kill everyone not completely inside the Titan. Windblade/Metroplex's linked mind drifts through space and time, as the cityspeaker loses her grip on reality and starts to feel isolated and alone... but as that thought seizes her mind, a vision of Metroplex offers her his hand with the assurance that she is never alone.</p>
                <p>United in purpose, Windblade and Metroplex deactivate the spacebridge. Disconnecting herself from the Titan, Windblade holds a hand up to silence Chromia, and strides past her friend and gives Starscream an offer he cannot refuse: if she frees him, he will keep everything that has occurred a secret, and in return, once Metroplex is well enough, she will allow Starscream unlimited access to the Titan's spacebridge.</p>
                <p>This will allow the leader of Cybertron to find and unite all of Cybertron's colony worlds, making the "Chosen One" the true savior of the entire Cybertronian race.</p>
                <p>As dawn nears, Windblade prepares to look for Circuit to try and prevent any information about what has gone on getting out. An abashed Chromia thanks Windblade for taking the blame for her; Windblade grants Chromia permission to leave Cybertron if she wants, but demands that Chromia follow her orders until that time. Chromia vows to serve her faithfully, and Windblade quietly hopes to herself that one day, her friend will believe in her too.</p>
                <div class="wind"></div>
                <p class="txt">Windblade launches into the dawn sky, with the vow that she has only just begun to fight for the safety of both her homes: Caminus <i>and</i> Cybertron.</p>
