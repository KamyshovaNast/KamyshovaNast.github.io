                <div class="img"></div>
                <p><strong>Chromia</strong> is a seasoned, tough-as-nails infiltrator who's adept at unflinching sabotage. Bluntly honest and a little married to her job, she doesn't make an ideal friend, but she can nevertheless be fiercely protective, a quality which also makes her an exceptional bodyguard.</p>
                <p>Her rough edges often find her a kinship with other like-minded security officers such as Ironhide. More diplomatic peers such as Windblade have attempted to socialize her, but beware—she might "arrange" an exit out of an overwhelming interpersonal situation with a quietly-placed detonator.
</p>
                <p>Chromia had stayed behind on Cybertron in order to protect and train Windblade as she performed her role as Metroplex's Cityspeaker. She was highly untrusting of Cybertron's elected ruler, Starscream, though Windblade preferred to give him the benefit of the doubt.
</p>
                <p>When Windblade sought advice on how to best interact with Starscream, Chromia scoffed at Windblade's choice of talking to the "mopey" Ironhide, but was visibly upset when Windblade teased her about telling Ironhide she described him as such.
</p>
                <p>Later, Chromia accompanied Windblade as the pair investigated an area of the city that might reveal why Metroplex was suffering blackouts, and at the end of the day Chromia insisted they not over-exert themselves and reconvene in the morning.
</p>
                <p>Chromia planted a bomb near where they'd be, in an attempt to make Windblade return to Caminus.  In the morning, when she and Windblade returned to the area, the bomb exploded, damaging Windblade. Chromia dragged her to medical care. 
</p>
                <p>Chromia was guarding Windblade when Starscream paid her a visit, and afterwards encouraged Windblade to pursue the idea that Starscream was behind the bomb.
</p>
                <p>Enlisting Ironhide's help, they followed up a lead in the form of Waspinator whom Chromia had to physically tackle when he tried to run. Chromia stayed in Blurr's bar while Windblade went with Waspinator.
</p>
                <p>After Windblade discovered Starscream was trying to mine ore from Metroplex, Chromia joined a team that went down to investigate. They were attacked by the Terrorcons and Chromia went instinctively to Windblade's aid, eventually managing to avoid being arrested when Starscream and Rattrap arrived.  
</p>
                <p>She arranged for Metroplex's spacebridge to activate, and organized a jail break, successfully springing Windblade and the others. As they headed for Metroplex, Windblade revealed that she believed Starscream wasn't behind the bomb. 
</p>
                <p>The pair rushed to Metroplex, where Chromia insisted Windblade merge with the Titan's mind. She fought with Starscream when he arrived, but he managed to injure Windblade and sliced off Chromia's right arm.
</p>
                <p>Windblade, merged with Metroplex, was able to subdue him with the Titan's internal defenses and revealed she'd discovered Chromia was behind the bomb. Though Chromia encouraged Windblade to make Metroplex jump back to Caminus, Windblade instead opted to shut the spacebridge down in favor of making a deal with Starscream.
