                <p><strong>Blurr</strong>. Racer. Soldier. Bartender. Hero.
</p>
                <p>He went on to attend the trial of Megatron and reestablish Maccadam's Old Oil House in Metroplex, what with Iacon being ruined and all. When Cityspeaker Windblade stopped by, he provided her with free drinks and complaints about the recent blackouts. After Windblade was injured in an explosion, Circuit and Longtooth showed up at Maccadam's looking to interview people on the matter, and Blurr had to show them the exit.
</p>
                <p>He later followed Windblade, Chromia, and the two reporters into Metroplex's insides to confirm Windblade's claim that Starscream was "mining" the titan for Regenesis ore. With Windblade in danger, Blurr rallied some of his regulars, and the misfit group wound up clashing with Starscream's Terrorcon enforcers.
</p>
                <p>The fight ended with Blurr and the others in custody; Starscream offered him amnesty... if he helped remove Windblade from her position of power, which Blurr wasn't keen on doing. When Chromia arrived to spring the gang, Blurr and the others stayed behind to distract the guards while the two Camiens made their way to Metroplex's command center. Blurr didn't hold out for long, and wound up unconscious while Starscream set off to confront Windblade.
</p>
                <p>After Starscream brought Wheeljack back online to help with a secret project, Blurr threw a party at Maccadam's to celebrate the return of his good friend.
</p>
                <p>Several weeks later, Cybertron had made formal contact with the lost colony world of Caminus, although diplomatic negotiations between the two planets went poorly due to a combiner arms race. During a lull in the fighting, Blurr served drinks to Mirage, Ironhide, and Sunstreaker.
</p>
                <p> With the combiner crisis averted, Blurr hosted another "Not the End of the World" party. He wound up trading barbs with Knock Out, a Velocitronian delegate whom Windblade had invited to showcase the melding of Cybertronian and Camien culture. Unable to convince Knock Out of their good intentions, Windblade hatched a new plan—enter Blurr into the Benefit 500 on Velocitron to beat them at their own game—a plan that Blurr was eager to get behind if it meant showing up the arrogant Velocitronian who had criticized his weight. Accompanied by Chromia and Ironhide, Windblade, and Blurr bridged to Velocitron.
</p>
                <p> After arriving at the city of Delta, Blurr joined the race as a last minute entry while Windblade and Chromia went off to meet Navitas, the planet's Titan. Eager to get back into the racing profession, Blurr found that the people of Velocitron were more than a match for the former racer: not only were they faster than him, they were unafraid to deploy all kinds of nasty gizmos to bump him into last place. Gaining a second wind, Blurr landed in first place after Windblade hacked into Navitas's brain module to reshape the track, taking out the competition and guiding Blurr to a suitably flashy victory. As the winner of the race, Blurr used his request to ask the people of Velocitron if they would join the Council of Worlds, to which they agreed.
